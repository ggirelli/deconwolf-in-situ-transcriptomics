# Notes

1. [x] plot showing the #assigned across a broad range of thresholds for -/+ dw (perhaps a line plot instead of a bar plot)? You could send us the table with numbers and we can play with it. Before deciding on the exact range of thresholds and how frequently to probe I would still like to see what happens in between 0.0001 and 0.001.
2. [x] plot showing the assigned/unassigned for the same range of thresholds.
3. [x] plot showing the quality scores for the same range of thresholds, but only for the same exact signals, so properly assigned ones in non-dw (this is a more fair comparison between non-dw and dw)
4. [x] plot showing the quality scores for the same range of thresholds, for all the signals.
5. [x] table showing the #counts for all the genes -/+ dw
6. [ ] based on the table we pick 4-6 genes to show their transcripts on a selected ROI (region you’re showing in your paper?)
7. [x] violin plots from your slide 7, but non-dw and dw next to each other (for each cell type)
8. [ ] Image like the one you have on slide 5 but perhaps with increased clarity? (I’m not sure what I should be seeing there at the moment)
